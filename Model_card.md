## Model Details
* **Model Name:** Milan Mobile Traffic Prediction
* **Version:** 1.0
* **Date:** June 13, 2025
* **Primary Use:** Forecast short-term mobile network demand in 10-minute intervals for specific areas within Milan.
* **Dataset Source:** Barlacchi, G., De Nadai, M., et al. (2015). A multi-source dataset of urban life in Milan and the Province of Trentino.

## Model Performance

| Target Variable   | RÂ² Score (Higher is Better) | RMSE (Lower is Better) |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------: | :--------------------: |
| **SMS Activity** |           0.9210            |         0.1420         |
| **Call Activity** |           0.9626            |         0.0738         |
| **Internet Traffic**|           0.9470            |         0.0923         |

The model demonstrates high accuracy across all targets, explaining over 92% of the variance. It is most effective at predicting call activity, which has the lowest prediction error.

## Data Preparation

### Initial Processing
* Timestamps were converted to a standard datetime format localized to 'Europe/Rome'.
* The dataset was filtered to focus on the central 2500 grid squares of Milan.
* Directional data (e.g., 'SMS-in'/'SMS-out') was merged into single activity features like 'SMS activity'.

### Feature Engineering
* **Temporal Features:** Created cyclical features for daily/weekly patterns and an `is_weekend` flag.
* **Spatial Features:** Derived grid coordinates and a grid density feature to represent the activity level of each location.
* **Target Transformation:** Applied log transformations to target variables to normalize their distributions and improve model performance.

### Data Splitting
A time-based splitting strategy was used to ensure the model is evaluated on data it has not seen before, which mimics a real-world forecasting scenario.

* **Training & Testing Period (Nov 1 - Dec 13):** The data from the beginning of the dataset until December 13th was used for model training and hyperparameter tuning, following an 80/20 split for training and testing respectively.
* **Validation Period (Dec 14 - Dec 31):** The data from December 14th to December 31st was held out as a final validation set to evaluate the performance of the chosen model on completely unseen future data.

## About the Model
The selected model is designed for a specific purpose. Here are its core details and intended uses.

### Intended Use
* **Primary Users:** Network operators for dynamic resource allocation and urban planners studying city dynamics.
* **Scope:** Forecasting short-term mobile network demand in Milan.

### Out-of-Scope Uses
* Predicting traffic for individual users (privacy-sensitive).
* Making long-term (e.g., year-ahead) forecasts.
* Forecasting for cities other than Milan without retraining on relevant local data.

## Ethical Considerations & Limitations

### Temporal Bias
The model is trained on data from Nov/Dec 2013 and may not generalize to other seasons, years, or periods with significantly different mobility patterns.

### Geographic Bias
The model is specific to Milan. Its spatial features and learned patterns will not be applicable to other cities without complete retraining.

### Data Representation
The dataset only captures activity on the Telecom Italia network and does not include traffic from other carriers or non-cellular activity (e.g., Wi-Fi).

### Fairness Considerations
The model predicts aggregate traffic and does not use demographic data. However, socio-economic factors may implicitly influence network usage patterns across different grid squares.
